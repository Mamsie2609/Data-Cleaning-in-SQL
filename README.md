# Data-Cleaning-in-SQL

## This project is focused on cleaning and preparing the Nashville Housing dataset for further analysis. The dataset contains information about various properties that have been sold in the city, including their sale price, address, and legal reference, among other attributes.

## The goal of this project is to clean and standardize the dataset to remove any inconsistencies or errors that could affect the accuracy of future analyses. The cleaning process involves standardising date formats, populating address data, breaking out address into individual colums (Address, City, State), removing duplicates, and standardizing values where applicable. The cleaning was done using Azure Data Studio.
